My pet project 

// Need to add

- Shop.dart:
  
  a) Add bloc for order food
  
  b) logic for 'chouse' what food need to display (like salads, sooups and st)
  
- Cart.dart:

  a) list items (to display what food need to order)

  b) Addres (just display text)
  
  c) Map (from Yandex or Google)
  
  d) Checkout Order (button without function)
 
 - Favorite.dart:

   a) List of food
  
 - After all of this:
   
   a) add function to add food in favorite and cart
   
   b) Maybe some animation when user press on "Checcout order"
   
   c) Animation if the food is highlighted on the screen, then you need to enlarge it and display the order button and reduce all other objects and remove the order button
   
// Need to fix

- The Theme.dart does not allow you to use the color of the text in the buttons
 
// Bad issue

- Only Android app without Desctop, web or IOS

- Static designt (No Adaptation)
